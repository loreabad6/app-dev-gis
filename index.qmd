:::

The lessons are meant to give you a broad overview of the basics and of what is possible with R for spatial analysis.
Learning by yourself is highly encouraged and expected.
The @sec-compmaterials section lists a number of additional resources for your self-learning, and at the end of the lessons you will have references to the relevant chapters for you to go through. 

In class, we will work with hand-on practicals that will allow you to develop R skills from the first lesson.

If you find yourself taking longer or having trouble with concepts, please ask for help on the course’s Blackboard message board or in class (there is an excellent chance someone else has the same question!) rather than via e-mail.

## Complementary course materials {#sec-compmaterials}

### Install R and Co.

To work on your own laptop, you need to install R, RStudio and Quarto to follow the course materials.

- Install R (>= 4.0) and RStudio (>= 2024.04.x with Quarto). You can follow the steps in Appendix 1 of [Hands-On Programming with R](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html). 
- If you are on Windows, install [Rtools for the R version](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) you have. 
-	Installing R spatial packages in Windows (Rtools is required, see above) and Mac should be straightforward, and we will do it together. If you have a Linux system, please read [this blogpost](https://geocompx.org/post/2020/installing-r-spatial-packages-linux/index.html).

If you have any problems with installation, please reach out via Blackboard.
