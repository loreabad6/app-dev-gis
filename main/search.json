Learning by yourself is highly encouraged and expected!\nThe Complementary course materials section lists a number of additional resources for your self-learning, and at the end of the lessons you will have references to the relevant chapters for you to go through.\nIn class, we will work with hand-on practicals that will allow you to develop R skills from the first lesson.\nIf you find yourself taking longer or having trouble with concepts, please ask for help on the course’s Blackboard message board or in class (there is an excellent chance someone else has the same question!) rather than via e-mail.\n\nAbout the use of AI\nUsing AI in this course is not discouraged if it helps you understand code or discover new ways of doing a task. Think of AI as an extended version of googling your issues or a Stack Overflow entry. However, beware to always test the code that you receive as an output, and also think about the logic that the AI tool follows. I expect that you learn from this course as much as possible, and copy pasting solutions generated by a LLM without critical thinking is unfortunately not going to meet those expectations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIf you select a final project using R, please add a disclaimer section explaining if you used AI for the completion of the project and how you used it.",

Use your function above to alter the top_secret object.\n\n# apply your function to the top_secret object and overwrite top_secret\ntop_secret = ... \n\nError: '...' used in an incorrect context\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheckpoint\n\n\n\nHeadquarters has informed you that at this stage of decoding, there should be 552 numbers in the secret message that are below 17.\n\n\nHint: This is what is called a “relational” comparison, where you compare an object to a number and R will give you a vector of TRUEs and FALSEs based on whether the comparison is / is not met. You can then use these TRUEs and FALSEs as numbers, since TRUE = 1 and FALSE = 0 in R land. This is called a Boolean variable type.\n\n# Write code to verify that there are 552 numbers with values **below** 17\n\n\nTurn your vector of numbers into a matrix with 5 columns, fill the values by column and not by row.\n\n\n# write your solution to prompt 4\n\n\nSeparately from your top_secret numbers, create a new vector called “evens” of all the even numbers between 1 and 552. That is, “evens” should contain 2, 4, 6, 8 …, 552.\n\n\n# write your solution to prompt 5\n\n\nSubtract the “evens” vector from the first column of your secret message matrix.\n\n\n# write your solution to prompt 6\n\n\nSubtract 100 from all numbers 18-24th rows of the 3rd column.\n\n\n# write your solution to prompt 7\n\n\nMultiply all numbers in the 4th and 5th column by 2.\n\n\n# write your solution to prompt 8\n\n\nTurn your matrix back into a vector.\n\n\n# write your solution to prompt 9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheckpoint\n\n\n\nHeadquarters has informed you that at this stage of decoding, all numbers in indices 500 and beyond are below 70.\n\n\nHint: Use a relational comparison similar to what you used in the last checkpoint, but here you will need to subset values from your vector! It may be helpful to think of below as not equal to or smaller than 70.\n\n# Write code to verify that indices 500 and beyond have values **below** 70\n\n\nTake the square root of all numbers in indices 38 to 465.\n\n\n# write your solution to prompt 10\n\n\nRound all numbers to the nearest whole number.\n\n\n# write your solution to prompt 11\n\n\nReplace all instances of the number 39 with 20.\n\n\n# write your solution to prompt 12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheckpoint\n\n\n\nHeadquarters has informed you that your final message should have 507 even numbers.\n\n\nHint: Checking for divisibility is an interesting operation that isn’t done much in R. Modulus is the operation you are interested in, where you are checking for whether the numbers are divisible by 2, with no remainder. See what you can find about modulus in R!\n\n# Code to verify how many even numbers are in your top_secret vector\n# Should be 507!",

This will remind later readers - which might be your future self! - what the desired output is.\nIf you created a new object, take a look at it, either by clicking its name in your Environment tab or by typing its name into the console. Make sure it looks about how you expect.\nIf you created or updated a data frame, make sure your edits did what you hoped. Use the Environment or the head() function to investigate your changes.\nMake sure you don’t have any overwritten objects between your error and your attempts to solve it.

    "text": "5.1.1 Earth observation analytics and remote sensing\nRemote sensing and Earth observation has had a big boost recently, especially since the ability to work with data out-of-memory1. Several workflows have become available to work with EO data within R to harness the statistical and visualisation capabilities of the programming language. Further, packages that allow retreival of EO data from cloud services are also available.\n\nI. Statistical modelling and machine learning\nSeveral packages are available to work with raster data as we saw last session, including {stars} and {terra}. One of the main use cases of raster data is to perform machine learning or statistical modelling.\nResources available:\n\nHow to perform statisticall modelling with {stars}\nBasics of remote sensing and classification workflow with {terra}\n\n\n\nII. Cloud data and on-demand data cubes\nWith the advent of common standards and specifications such as the Spatio Temporal Asset Catalog (STAC), accessing data from the cloud has become much easier. Once data can be accessed in an standardised way, working with on-demand data cubes locally becomes a much easier process.\nThe package {rstac} provides the workforce to fetch STAC data. This package is the basis for other packages workflows to download data, to create data cubes, or to do it all at once.\n Here you will find the package documentation.\nAnother interesting package is {rsi}, which stands for remote sensing indices. The package basically obtains data using {rstac} but also connects to the Awesome Spectral Indices catalogue to fetch standardised ways to compute popular spectral indices on your data.\n Resources for {rsi}:\n\nPackage documentation\nBlogpost: An overview of the rsi R package for retrieving satellite imagery and calculating spectral indices by Rydzik (2024)\n\nFinally, the creation of on-demand data cubes is taken care of in R using the {gdalcubes} package. With this package you can create data cubes from cloud resources or local files, apply data cube operations (apply functions over dimensions, filtering, computing statistics with reductions), extract time series, create training data for machine learning.\n Resources for {gdalcubes}:\n\nPackage documentation\nWorkshop: Analyzing satellite image collections on public cloud platforms with R\n\n\n\nIII. All-in-one solution\nTo concentrate all the efforts of fetching data from the cloud, creating on-demand data cubes, and performing statistical modelling or applying machine learning algorithms to the data, the {sits} package was created. It build upon the packages shown above and it can be seen as an all-in-one solution that simplifies the usage of satellite imagery time series. The main focus is of course on time series analysis, therefore taking the time component into account for the modelling.\nA typical workflow in {sits} would look like this:\n\n\n\nUsing time series for land classification. Source: Câmara et al. (2023)\n\n\n Resources for {sits}:\n\nBook: sits: Satellite Image Time Series Analysis on Earth Observation Data Cubes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n💻 Code at Work: Your Turn to Execute\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will explore the {gdalcubes} package in the hands-on part of this section.

The aim of the package is to bridge between {sf} and {tidygraph} a tidy wrapper of the C++ {igraph} library which is used very often for network analysis.\nWith {sfnetworks} you can perform several tasks such as:\n\ncreating networks from points and lines\nnetwork cleaning\nfinding shortest paths\nroute optimisation\nclosest facility analysis\ncreating catchment areas\nzoning networks based on their connectivity\n…\n\nIt started as an assignment for an R course in an effort to find an open source solution to the ArcGIS network analysis capabilities and is now downloaded over 2 thousand times a month!\n I recommend you to work with the development version (here are the docs).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n💻 Code at Work: Your Turn to Execute\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will create a shortest facility analysis workflow with {sfnetworks}.

    "section": "5.2 Bridges to external software",
    "text": "5.2 Bridges to external software\nOf course, you can also connect to external GIS software to perform operations in R. Why would you want to do that? One good reason is to automate your workflows. Instead of following a click, click, click sequence, you can have your process in a coded written form that allows you to remember what you did as it is written and documented, but also perform the same process over and over via automation.\n\n5.2.1 QGIS\nOne of the best bridges to GIS with R out there is the {qgisprocess} package, which wraps around the “qgis process” command line. There is also a {qgis} package with the same idea but does a function per algorithm. It does not only give you access to native QGIS processing tools but also to any other add-on you have made available via your QGIS installation including plug-ins. That means, GRASS GIS, GDAL, SAGA are fully available to you via inside R with one package!\n Resources to bridge with QGIS\n\n{qgisprocess} package documentation\n{qgis} package documentation\nSection in Bridges to GIS software in Lovelace et al. (2019)\nPresentation at UseR! 2024 by Floris Vanderhaeghe for more info on {qgis} and {qgisprocess}\n\nNaturally, for this to work, you will need a QGIS installation. The package will try to find your installation automatically on your first run. However, you can also pass a custom path if you have multiple installations.\nDepending on your QGIS configuration, you will have access to different providers. You can look at what is available to you with qgis_providers().\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2.2 SAGA GIS\nYou also have individual bridges to GIS software naturally. If you are interested in geomorphology and hydrology, you might be very familiar with SAGA GIS. You can access SAGA algorithms via QGIS, but if you don’t have that linked or if you rather use a package with less dependencies, then {Rsagacmd} is for you. There is also the {RSAGA} package, however, this does not have so good documentation, and its development seems a bit paused.\n Resources for SAGA GIS bridges with R\n\nPackage documentation for {Rsagacmd}\nSection in Bridges to GIS software in Lovelace et al. (2019)\nThe GitHub repository of the {RSAGA} package\nA package I built to automise my workflows based on {RSAGA}\n\nAgain, you will need to have a SAGA GIS installation or point the package to the installation path of the SAGA GIS version you would like to use.\n\n\n5.2.3 GRASS GIS\nDoes anyone know what GRASS2 stands for?\nGRASS GIS has been around since the 80s and is one of the most powerful GIS out there. It has been ahead of its time for so long and it keeps up-to-date with current GIS trends. Its community of developers and users is also thriving, even having annual workshops that allow the further development of the tools supported.\nIt is a core part of the OSGeo suite of sofware, available in loads of languages, has really good cloud-support and as one of the core members, Vero Andreo always likes to say: it rocks!\n Resources to work with GRASS GIS\n\n{rgrass} package documentation\nTutorial: Get started with GRASS & R: the rgrass package by Andreo (2024)\nPresentation at UseR! 2024 by Vero Andreo (core member of GRASS GIS)\nSection in Bridges to GIS software in Lovelace et al. (2019)\nModernizing the R-GRASS interface: confronting barn-raised OSGeo libraries and the evolving R.*spatial package ecosystem by R. Bivand (2022)\n\nNaturally, you will need an installation of GRASS to be able to run the algorithms with this package.\n\n\n5.2.4 Google Earth Engine (GEE)\nBindings to GEE are available via the {rgee} package. The efforts towards this connection were driven by a former student here at PLUS! It does not only have now the connection to GEE but also functions that build on top of it and a book with good documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGEE binding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtra functions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBook\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1: RGEE package bundle\n\n\n\nThis bridge of course requires you to have a Google Earth Engine account that will allow you to authenticate. The documentation of the package has all the required steps to get started.\n\n\n5.2.5 R-ArcGIS Bridge\nESRI has also made efforts to connect to open source software. You already know how to connect ArcGIS to Python, using the arcpy interface. For R, ESRI has created a bundle of packages that, when you have ArcGIS Pro and a valid license, you can use to run their geoprocessing tools.\n Here you can find the documentation to install and quick start with these packages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\n\n\n\nI will not support your use of proprietary software in this course, but if you are interested and even if you would like to use it in your project, feel free to do so.",

Make sure to do this step, as we will use the function you create next class.\n\nExploring other packages\nIf you feel like exploring other packages outside of the samples I gave or one of the bridges to external GIS software, feel free to do so. Use the materials provided under each section!\nI recommend to play with the bridges if you already have the software installed and you are familiar with it, otherwise it might take too long for today’s class. You would also need to have a workflow inside a function by the end of the class.\nYou don’t need to submit today’s work, but save it for next class!",
