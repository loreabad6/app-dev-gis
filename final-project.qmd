# Final project {.unnumbered}

## General information

See the information given on Blackboard.

## R project

R Projects can either be delivered as:

### Option A. Quarto reproducible workflow

- **A spatial analysis reproducible workflow**. 
- Be sure to use the Quarto functionalities to add documentation and explanations of your workflow alongside code and output
- You can choose the topic you want to work on, including other projects you have implemented in other courses and programming languages and "translating" them to R
- You should include at least one visual element (interactive map, static map, graphs and plots, tables)
    
::: {.callout-important}
## Submission on Blackboard

1. **Quarto document (.qmd)** file
    - Make sure to include any data not publicly accessible
    - The .qmd file should be fully reproducible
2. **Report** including:
    - two line description of your work
    - a link to the published Quarto document on a website (hosted on GitHub) 
    - an [AI use disclaimer](#sec-ai)
    - a contribution section when working in groups: 
      - specify for all group members: 1) How much they contributed (every group member has to contribute at least 40% of the entire work) and 2) What they contributed (programming, documentation, …)
:::

    
### Option B. R package

- **Automate a spatial analysis workflow**. Think of a task that you often have to do an automate it by organising your R code in a package
- The package should be **released on GitHub** and **should have at least one vignette** explaining the main functionalities
    
::: {.callout-important}
## Submission on Blackboard

1. **Report** including:
    - two line description of your work
    - a link to the GitHub repository with your package and at least one vignette
      - the package should be possible to install locally using `remotes::install_github()`
    - an [AI use disclaimer](#sec-ai)
    - a contribution section when working in groups: 
      - specify for all group members: 1) How much they contributed (every group member has to contribute at least 40% of the entire work) and 2) What they contributed (programming, documentation, …)

## Ideas with an extra twist:

### Quarto report ideas

-	Multi-language Quarto file to compare and benchmark spatial analyses in R and Python. 
    - See an [example of a R and Python combined workflow here](https://loreabad6.github.io/posts/2023-10-17-stac-across-languages/) ([raw .qmd file here](https://github.com/loreabad6/loreabad6.github.io/blob/main/posts/2023-10-17-stac-across-languages/index.qmd))
-	[Quarto dashboard](https://quarto.org/docs/dashboards/) with interactive maps to visualise the results of spatial analysis or an interesting dataset.
    - See an [example of a R spatial dashboard here](https://pub.demo.posit.team/public/nz-quakes/quakes.html)

### R package ideas 

R packages should have at least one vignette explaining main functionalities

-	An R package to automate a workflow normally performed in QGIS/GRASS/SAGA-GIS/etc.
    - Calculating terrain derivatives
    - Computing zonal statistics
-	An R package to interface the sen2cube.at API. 
    - See a first attempt here: <https://github.com/Sen2Cube-at/sen2cubeR>
-	An R package to run the NetAScore toolbox
    - Calling docker within R with the CLI
    - <https://github.com/plus-mobilitylab/netascore>
