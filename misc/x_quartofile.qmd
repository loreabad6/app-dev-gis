In this document, we will load a *spatial dataset* with the `sf` package.

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| message: false
library(sf)
nc = read_sf(system.file("shape/nc.shp", package="sf"))
```

We can see how the `nc` object looks like:

```{r}
nc
```

And we can also **plot** it:

```{r}
#| label: plot
#| echo: false
plot(nc['AREA'])
```
