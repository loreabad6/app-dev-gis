### About the use of AI {#sec-ai}

Using AI in this course is not discouraged if it helps you understand code or discover new ways of doing a task.
Think of AI as an extended version of googling your issues or a Stack Overflow entry.
However, beware to always test the code that you receive as an output, and also think about the logic that the AI tool follows.
I expect that you learn from this course as much as possible, and copy pasting solutions generated by a LLM without critical thinking is unfortunately not going to meet those expectations.

If you select a final project using R, please add a disclaimer section explaining if you used AI for the completion of the project and how you used it.
