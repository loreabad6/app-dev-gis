Think of AI as an extended version of googling your issues or a Stack Overflow entry. However, beware to always test the code that you receive as an output, and also think about the logic that the AI tool follows. I expect that you learn from this course as much as possible, and copy pasting solutions generated by a LLM without critical thinking is unfortunately not going to meet those expectations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIf you select a final project using R, please add a disclaimer section explaining if you used AI for the completion of the project and how you used it.",

    "text": "Different to compiled language, like C or JAVA, R’s default implementation is an interpreted language. R is a dynamic programming language, which means R automatically interprets your code as you run it. Python is tipically first compiled and then interpreted, but the compilation is hidden from the user.\nR packages are organized via The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). Mature R packages are submitted to CRAN where checks are performed on their backward compatibility against other packages and R versions and operating systems. There is no CRAN for Python packages, which sometimes makes it harder to handle versioning of the packages you work with.\n\n\nCRAN is a network of ftp and web servers around the world that store identical, up-to-date, versions of code and documentation for R.\n\n\nR uses a particular assign operator: &lt;-. However, you will see code and in particular in this lessons using: =. You can use them interchangeably and this won’t affect your code. So if you are used to Python, you can stick to =.\nR has different coding paradigms, most importantly base or vanilla R, tidyverse and data.table.\nPiping: if you are familiar with the R tidyverse, you might have seen the use of the %&gt;% operator to concatenate functions. Since R 4.1.0 R introduced a native pipe operator |&gt; and that is what we use in this course. If you are curious about how the native pipe works and differences with the magrittr pipe, see here and here.\nCode syntax is of course different. For instance, Python indexes from 0 and R from 1.

(2023):\n\nWhen requirements change, you only update code once.\nEliminate errors from copy-pasting. e.g. you won’t forget to update a variable name in all the places you use it.\nOrganized code: you can name your function something intuitive to remind you of the task you are undertaking.\nReuse workflows between projects, making you more efficient.\n\nAn R function has three elements:\n\nname = function(arguments) {\n  body\n}\n\n\nname\narguments: elements that vary across calls\nbody: code that is repeated across calls\n\nYou will find fundamentals of calling functions in R right here.\nPractical 3 is about writing functions in R.

    "text": "2.3 Spatial data\nSpatial data is special, you already know this. Coordinates, projections and transformations, geometries, vector data types, raster and gridded data: these are a sample of the characteristics spatial software has to take into account.\nSpatial data in R has had a long history and evolution. Spatial packages were developed already from the time R’s predecessor, the S language, was around in the 1990s. Many package developments have taken place until getting to the current state of R-Spatial packages. We will take a look at the current package ecosystem next session.\n\n2.3.1 The {sf} package\nSimple Features for R {sf} (Pebesma, 2018) is currently the main R package to handle spatial data. Simple features are a formal OGC standard (ISO 19125-1:2004) that describes how objects in the real world can be represented in computers.\nGeometry types: points, lines, polygons, or their derivatives are represented by this OGC hierarchical data model. {sf} supports the following geometry types:\n\n\n\nSimple features supported by {sf} from Lovelace et al. (2019)\n\n\nThe {sf} package was designed to fit tidy data workflows. To do so, it keeps the philosophy of one row per observation, one column per variable. As such, the geometry of each observation is treated as a variable and is place in a geometry column.\nBut the geometry column in a sf object is special in different ways:\n\nit is a “sticky” column, which means it is not easily dropped by any data operations you perform, e.g. when you select a column in a sf object, the geometry column will stay there.\nit is a “list-column”, which means it is a nested column.\nit has its own class: sfc, which is a standalone class where methods for sfc objects can be applied.\n\n\n\nsfc methods\nlibrary(sf)\nmethods(class = \"sfc\")\n##  [1] [                            [&lt;-                         \n##  [3] as.data.frame                c                           \n##  [5] coerce                       format                      \n##  [7] fortify                      identify                    \n##  [9] initialize                   obj_sum                     \n## [11] Ops                          points                      \n## [13] print                        rep                         \n## [15] scale_type                   show                        \n## [17] slotsFromS3                  st_area                     \n## [19] st_as_binary                 st_as_grob                  \n## [21] st_as_s2                     st_as_sf                    \n## [23] st_as_text                   st_bbox                     \n## [25] st_boundary                  st_break_antimeridian       \n## [27] st_buffer                    st_cast                     \n## [29] st_centroid                  st_collection_extract       \n## [31] st_concave_hull              st_convex_hull              \n## [33] st_coordinates               st_crop                     \n## [35] st_crs                       st_crs&lt;-                    \n## [37] st_difference                st_exterior_ring            \n## [39] st_geometry                  st_inscribed_circle         \n## [41] st_intersection              st_intersects               \n## [43] st_is_full                   st_is_valid                 \n## [45] st_is                        st_line_merge               \n## [47] st_m_range                   st_make_valid               \n## [49] st_minimum_bounding_circle   st_minimum_rotated_rectangle\n## [51] st_nearest_points            st_node                     \n## [53] st_normalize                 st_point_on_surface         \n## [55] st_polygonize                st_precision                \n## [57] st_reverse                   st_sample                   \n## [59] st_segmentize                st_set_precision            \n## [61] st_shift_longitude           st_simplify                 \n## [63] st_snap                      st_sym_difference           \n## [65] st_transform                 st_triangulate_constrained  \n## [67] st_triangulate               st_union                    \n## [69] st_voronoi                   st_wrap_dateline            \n## [71] st_write                     st_z_range                  \n## [73] st_zm                        str                         \n## [75] summary                      text                        \n## [77] type_sum                     vec_cast.sfc                \n## [79] vec_ptype2.sfc              \n## see '?methods' for accessing help and source code\n\n\n\n\n\nArtwork from Allison Horst\n\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Turning X/Y data into a sf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n💻 Code at Work: Your Turn to Execute\n\n\n\n\nConvert your data object to a spatial object. For this we will use the sf package.\n\n\n# The `st_as_sf()` function is used to convert a foreign object into a sf object\n# If you have a tabular dataset with X/Y or lat/long columns, this can be \n# turned into a sf by passing it as a vector to the `coords` parameter\n# Don't forget to also assign the correct `crs` to your object\ndata_sf = st_as_sf(\n  data_ec,\n  coords = c(\"longitude_deg\", \"latitude_deg\"),\n  crs = 4326 # this is the projection the data is in\n)\n\n\nTake a look at the new spatial object you created, how is it different from the tabular format we had before?\n\n\ndata_sf\n\nSimple feature collection with 357 features and 12 fields\nGeometry type: POINT\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: -90.953 ymin: -4.37823 xmax: -75.39438 ymax: 1.264791\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\n# A tibble: 357 × 13\n       id ident   type    name  elevation_ft iso_country iso_region municipality\n *  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;       \n 1  41595 EC-0001 small_… Cara…          126 EC          EC-O       Carabon     \n 2 308084 EC-0002 closed  Seym…           NA EC          EC-W       Isla Baltra \n 3 317181 EC-0003 closed  Old …          170 EC          EC-R       Santa Rosa  \n 4 323803 EC-0004 small_… Nuev…           NA EC          EC-D       Nuevo Rocaf…\n 5 323805 EC-0005 small_… Loro…          630 EC          EC-Y       Lorocachi   \n 6 323806 EC-0006 small_… Pava…           NA EC          EC-Y       Pavacachi   \n 7 323808 EC-0007 small_… Jaim…          849 EC          EC-Y       Quilloalpa  \n 8 323809 EC-0008 small_… Tara…           NA EC          EC-Y       Taracoa     \n 9 323810 EC-0009 small_… Yuca…           NA EC          EC-Y       &lt;NA&gt;        \n10 323811 EC-0010 small_… Paca…           NA EC          EC-Y       Pacayacu    \n# ℹ 347 more rows\n# ℹ 5 more variables: scheduled_service &lt;chr&gt;, gps_code &lt;chr&gt;, iata_code &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   local_code &lt;chr&gt;, geometry &lt;POINT [°]&gt;\n\n\n\nWe can have a quick visual of the dataset now that we have given it coordinates. You can use the base R function plot() for this.\n\n\n# This function will plot the first 9 parameters of the sf object, \n# unless specified otherwise\n# This might take a bit depending on how good your computer is, \n# as we are plotting 80 thousand points ;)\nplot(data_sf)\n\nWarning: plotting the first 10 out of 12 attributes; use max.plot = 12 to plot\nall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# You can also create a quick interactive map\nlibrary(mapview)\nmapview(data_sf)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut this basic plot is not really a map just yet. Let’s make a map again for the airports in your home country. You will need to filter the data again, which is something you can do also in sf objects.\n\n\n# We can use ggplot again to create a map! Here the `geom_sf()` function will be of use\nggplot(data_sf) +\n  geom_sf(aes(color = type)) +\n  # to do projections on the fly\n  coord_sf(crs = 24817)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne extra feature we can add is a country base layer to help locate the information. For this we can use the rnaturalearth package.\n\n\nlibrary(rnaturalearth)\n# You can add the name of your country \ncountry = ne_countries(scale = 50, country = \"Ecuador\")\n\n\nHere we plot both layers in one map\n\n\n# Here we will call the ggplot function again but with different spatial layers\n# Since we want to have the country boundary in the background\n# we will call that function first and then the data object we filtered above\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = country) +\n  geom_sf(data = data_sf, aes(color = type)) +\n  coord_sf(crs = 24817)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomise your map, play a bit with the options you have. It makes sense you are not familiar with everything but you can start exploring. I customised my map you can see the full code to create it in the next section.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.3 A customised map\n\n\nFull code for a more customised map\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(rnaturalearth)\n# Read in the data\ndata = read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/loreabad6/app-dev-gis/main/data/data_lesson2.csv\")\ndata_sf_ec = data |&gt; \n  # Directly transform to sf\n  st_as_sf(coords = c(\"longitude_deg\", \"latitude_deg\"), crs = 4326) |&gt; \n  # Filter for my home country\n  filter(iso_country == \"EC\") |&gt;\n  # Transform airport type to nice labels by capitalising the first letter and removing the snakecase\n  mutate(type = str_to_sentence(str_replace_all(type, \"_\", \" \"))) |&gt; \n  # Relevel or reorder the types to have them in a more logical order\n  mutate(type = fct_relevel(type, \"Large airport\", \"Medium airport\",\n                            \"Small airport\", \"Heliport\", \"Closed\")) \n# Obtain Ecuador but also surrounding countries for context\ncountries = ne_countries(scale = 50, country = c(\"Colombia\",\"Ecuador\",\"Peru\"))\n# Extract Ecuador to obtain its bounding box and focus on it in coord_sf\necuador = countries |&gt; filter(sovereignt == \"Ecuador\")\nec_bbox = ecuador |&gt; \n  # Transform before getting the bounding box to match the CRS in the plot\n  st_transform(24817) |&gt; st_bbox()\n\nggplot() +\n  # add the country layer\n  geom_sf(data = countries, fill = \"grey90\", color = \"white\") +\n  # add the data, changed the shape to a dot with a fill and border color, \n  # assgined an alpha or opacity to not oclude the points\n  geom_sf(data = data_sf_ec, aes(fill = type, size = type),\n          shape = 21, alpha = 0.8) +\n  # Change the fill palette\n  scale_fill_brewer(\"Airport type\", palette = \"Dark2\") +\n  # Manually assign point sizes\n  scale_size_manual(\"Airport type\", values = c(6, 4, 2, 1, 0.25)) +\n  # Change the CRS to a projected one to avoid distorsions. \n  # Focus the map on Ecuador by using the bounding box extent\n  coord_sf(\n    crs = 24817,\n    xlim = c(ec_bbox[\"xmin\"], ec_bbox[\"xmax\"]),\n    ylim = c(ec_bbox[\"ymin\"], ec_bbox[\"ymax\"])\n  ) +\n  # use a more minimal theme\n  theme_bw() +\n  # change the legend to the bottom\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to try at home…\n\n\n\n… you know, if you are bored.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can keep playing with your map to get familiar with the ggplot package, customise it further, add scale and north arrows… your imagination (and maybe the ggplot extensions available) is the limit.\nAnother thing you can try is to create a function that automatically generates the map for a given country.",

    "text": "Part Two: Decoding the secret message.\nThis chunk (which should NOT have errors) will load up the encoded secret message as a vector:\n\ntop_secret &lt;- read.csv(\n  \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/loreabad6/app-dev-gis/main/practicals/Practical2/Secret_Code_AppDev\", \n  header = TRUE)$x\n\nBy altering this top secret set of numbers, you will be able to create a message. Write your own code to complete the steps below.\n\nAdd 14 to every number (already done for you 😉)\n\n\ntop_secret &lt;- top_secret + 14\n\n\nMultiply every number by 18, then subtract 257.\n\n\n# write your solution to prompt 1\n\n\nExponentiate every number.

You can then use these TRUEs and FALSEs as numbers, since TRUE = 1 and FALSE = 0 in R land. This is called a Boolean variable type.\n\n# Write code to verify that there are 352 numbers with values **below** 17\n\n\nTurn your vector of numbers into a matrix with 5 columns.\n\n\n# write your solution to prompt 4\n\n\nSeparately from your top_secret numbers, create a new vector called “evens” of all the even numbers between 1 and 428. That is, “evens” should contain 2, 4, 6, 8 …, 428.\n\n\n# write your solution to prompt 5\n\n\nSubtract the “evens” vector from the first column of your secret message matrix.\n\n\n# write your solution to prompt 6\n\n\nSubtract 100 from all numbers 18-24th rows of the 3rd column.\n\n\n# write your solution to prompt 7\n\n\nMultiply all numbers in the 4th and 5th column by 2.\n\n\n# write your solution to prompt 8\n\n\nTurn your matrix back into a vector.\n\n\n# write your solution to prompt 9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheckpoint\n\n\n\nHeadquarters has informed you that at this stage of decoding, all numbers in indices 1000 and beyond are below 70.\n\n\nHint: Use a relational comparison similar to what you used in the last checkpoint, but here you will need to subset values from your vector! It may be helpful to think of below 100 as not equal to or greater than 70.\n\n# Write code to verify that indices 1000 and beyond have values **below** 70\n# should be 0!\n\n\nTake the square root of all numbers in indices 38 to 465.\n\n\n# write your solution to prompt 10\n\n\nRound all numbers to the nearest whole number.\n\n\n# write your solution to prompt 11\n\n\nReplace all instances of the number 39 with 20.\n\n\n# write your solution to prompt 12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheckpoint\n\n\n\nHeadquarters has informed you that your final message should have 820 even numbers.\n\n\nHint: Checking for divisibility is an interesting operation that isn’t done much in R. Modulus is the operation you are interested in, where you are checking for whether the numbers are divisible by 2, with no remainder. See what you can find about modulus in R!\n\n# Code to verify how many even numbers are in your top_secret vector\n# Should be 820!",

    "text": "{ggplot2}\nPart of the tidyverse, ggplot2 is one of the go to packages for data visualisation in R.\nThere are plenty of tutorials out there on how to use ggplot2 for your data visualisation. Here is a very nice one by Cedric Scherer and another three-part one focused on maps by Mel Moreno and Mathieu Basille.\nYou will find native support to plot both sf (geom_sf()) and stars (raster; geom_stars()) objects.\nChoosing ggplot will allow you to use some of its many extensions. For example, the package {ggtext} let’s you customise colors in the text in your plot. For spatial elements such as north arrows and scales you can check out {ggspatial}.\nTo save your ggplot you can use the following:\n\nmymap = ggplot() +\n  geom_sf(...) +\n  theme(...)\n\nggsave(filename = \"path/to/your/plot/location/mymap.png\", plot = mymap,\n       width = 15, height = 10, units = \"cm\", dpi = 300) # adjust as necessary\n\n\n\n{tmap}\nAn R package for drawing thematic maps. This package tries to follow on the grammar of graphics principles of {ggplot2} but also provides a bit more flexibility. I personally use it for its versatility in switching between static and interactive, for its ease to build facet plots with free spatial axes and for the thought they put in particular cartography principles.\nVersion 4.0 has been cooking for a while and you will find the documentation here. You will also find a guide for making maps with {tmap} in the Geocomputation with R book.\nTo save your tmap you can use the following:\n\nmymap = tm_shape() +\n  tm_fill()\n\ntmap_save(tm = mymap, filename = \"path/to/your/plot/location/mymap.png\",\n       width = 15, height = 10, units = \"cm\", dpi = 300) # adjust as necessary\n\n\n\nBase R\nAlthough not the easiest to customise, you can definitely make nice maps using base R. Can you also make ugly maps with it?\nYou will find some basics on plotting sf objects in the {sf} plotting vignette in the package documentation here.\nTo save your plot to disk you can use the following code:\n\npng(filename = \"path/to/your/plot/location/mymap.png\",\n    width = 15, height = 10, units = \"cm\") # adjust as necessary\n\nplot(...) # the code for your plot goes here\n\ndevice.off()\n\nWith this code your plot will not render on the RStudio viewer but directly on the file you created. I recommend you to wrap your plot() code at the complete end, once you are done with your editing.",

    "text": "Advice for dealing with errors\nErrors can be sneaky - check results often\nIf a chunk of code runs smoothly without giving you any error or warnings this does not necessarily mean it accomplished the desired task.\nIt is a good habit to check the results of your code every time you finish a task.\nTwo heads are better than one\nIt can be hard to spot bugs in code that you wrote.\nWork with those around you - if something goes wrong, ask a friend to take a peek at your code and see if any glaring errors (like syntax error) pop out.\nExplain your code out loud\nThe best way to troubleshoot a sneaky but is to explain out loud each step of your code, and what you hoped to accomplish.\nIf you are alone, try Rubber Duck Debugging!\nGoogle is your friend\nThe whole of the internet is at your disposal! Use it early, use it often.\nSome tricks:",

This will remind later readers - which might be your future self! - what the desired output is.\nIf you created a new object, take a look at it, either by clicking its name in your Environment tab or by typing its name into the console. Make sure it looks about how you expect.\nIf you created or updated a data frame, make sure your edits did what you hoped. Use the Environment or the head() function to investigate your changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy-paste the exact error message into Google. Chances are, somebody else had a similar problem and got a similar message.\nInclude package names in your search terms. For example, “bar plot in ggplot” is a better search than “bar plot in R”.\n\n\n\n\n\nHijmans, R. (2020). Terra and luna: New r packages scalable geospatial data analysis.
