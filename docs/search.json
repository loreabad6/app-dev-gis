Think of AI as an extended version of googling your issues or a Stack Overflow entry. However, beware to always test the code that you receive as an output, and also think about the logic that the AI tool follows. I expect that you learn from this course as much as possible, and copy pasting solutions generated by a LLM without critical thinking is unfortunately not going to meet those expectations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIf you select a final project using R, please add a disclaimer section explaining if you used AI for the completion of the project and how you used it.",

    "text": "Different to compiled language, like C or JAVA, R’s default implementation is an interpreted language. R is a dynamic programming language, which means R automatically interprets your code as you run it. Python is tipically first compiled and then interpreted, but the compilation is hidden from the user.\nR packages are organized via The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). Mature R packages are submitted to CRAN where checks are performed on their backward compatibility against other packages and R versions and operating systems. There is no CRAN for Python packages, which sometimes makes it harder to handle versioning of the packages you work with.\n\n\nCRAN is a network of ftp and web servers around the world that store identical, up-to-date, versions of code and documentation for R.\n\n\nR uses a particular assign operator: &lt;-. However, you will see code and in particular in this lessons using: =. You can use them interchangeably and this won’t affect your code. So if you are used to Python, you can stick to =.\nR has different coding paradigms, most importantly base or vanilla R, tidyverse and data.table.\nPiping: if you are familiar with the R tidyverse, you might have seen the use of the %&gt;% operator to concatenate functions. Since R 4.1.0 R introduced a native pipe operator |&gt; and that is what we use in this course. If you are curious about how the native pipe works and differences with the magrittr pipe, see here and here.\nCode syntax is of course different. For instance, Python indexes from 0 and R from 1.

    "text": "1.2 Base or “vanilla” R\nOn the note above you find several examples of code syntax for base or “vanilla” R. R has several coding syntax. Knowing the basics of base R allows you to write R code without having to depend on other packages. However, most data science workflows are facilitated by other coding syntaxes such as tidyverse and data.table. In this lesson, you will be solving a practical using base R (Practical 2). In coming lessons, we will include the tidyverse into our workflows.",

If you find yourself repeating a piece of code over and over and just changing one parameter, then you can probably replace that workflow with a function.\nReasons to create a function, as explained in Wickham et al. (2023):\n\nWhen requirements change, you only update code once.\nEliminate errors from copy-pasting. e.g. you won’t forget to update a variable name in all the places you use it.\nOrganized code: you can name your function something intuitive to remind you of the task you are undertaking.\nReuse workflows between projects, making you more efficient.\n\nAn R function has three elements:\n\nname = function(arguments) {\n  body\n}\n\n\nname\narguments: elements that vary across calls\nbody: code that is repeated across calls\n\nPractical 3 is about writing functions in R. There you will practice this function syntax.",

    "text": "1.4 Quarto crash course\nIn this course, we will be using Quarto documents for the practicals. This website itself is created using Quarto.\n\nQuarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system.\nIt allows you to combine code, results and text in a single document.\nIt uses Markdown syntax.\nWith Quarto, you can create reproducible documents in several output formats like PDF, HTML, Word, presentations with Reveal.js, etc.\nIt has native support for multiple programming languages like Python and Julia in addition to R.\nIt can also render Jupyter notebooks.\n\n\n1.4.1 Anatomy of a Quarto file\nA plain text file that has the extension .qmd is a Quarto file:\n\n\n---\ntitle: I am a Quarto file\ndate: today\nformat: html\n---\n\nIn this document, we will load a *spatial dataset* \nwith the `sf` package.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: setup\n#| message: false\nlibrary(sf)\nnc = read_sf(system.file(\"shape/nc.shp\", package=\"sf\"))\n```\n\nWe can see how the `nc` object looks like:\n\n```{r}\nnc\n```\n\nAnd we can also **plot** it:\n\n```{r}\n#| label: plot\n#| echo: false\nplot(nc['AREA'])\n```\n\n\nYou will notice three basic components of the file:\n\nMetadata: YAML\n\n“Yet Another Markup Language” or “YAML Ain’t Markup Language” is used to provide metadata. Depending on the type of document you are authoring, several parameters are available. Parameters can be nested and therefore indentation is important. It is kept between --- in the form:\n---\nkey: value\n---\n\nText: Markdown\n\nText is done with Markdown syntax. If you are not familiar with this, here are some basics: Text section of Intro to Quarto by Charlotte Wickham.\n\nCode: R executed via knitr\n\nExecutable code is contained in chunks surrounded by ```.\nThe more you get familiar with Quarto documents, the more you will be able to do. Interactive documents, including dashboards are also supported by Quarto. Your final project should be reported using Quarto.",

Make sure it looks about how you expect.\nIf you created or updated a data frame, make sure your edits did what you hoped. Use the Environment or the head() function to investigate your changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy-paste the exact error message into Google. Chances are, somebody else had a similar problem and got a similar message.\nInclude package names in your search terms.
