Learning by yourself is highly encouraged and expected. The Complementary course materials section lists a number of additional resources for your self-learning, and at the end of the lessons you will have references to the relevant chapters for you to go through.\nIn class, we will work with hand-on practicals that will allow you to develop R skills from the first lesson.\nIf you find yourself taking longer or having trouble with concepts, please ask for help on the course’s Blackboard message board or in class (there is an excellent chance someone else has the same question!) rather than via e-mail.\n\nAbout the use of AI\nUsing AI in this course is not discouraged if it helps you understand code or discover new ways of doing a task. Think of AI as an extended version of googling your issues or a Stack Overflow entry. However, beware to always test the code that you receive as an output, and also think about the logic that the AI tool follows. I expect that you learn from this course as much as possible, and copy pasting solutions generated by a LLM without critical thinking is unfortunately not going to meet those expectations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIf you select a final project using R, please add a disclaimer section explaining if you used AI for the completion of the project and how you used it.",

You can then use these TRUEs and FALSEs as numbers, since TRUE = 1 and FALSE = 0 in R land. This is called a Boolean variable type.\n\n# Write code to verify that there are 352 numbers with values **below** 17\n\n\nTurn your vector of numbers into a matrix with 5 columns.\n\n\n# write your solution to prompt 4\n\n\nSeparately from your top_secret numbers, create a new vector called “evens” of all the even numbers between 1 and 428.

It may be helpful to think of below 100 as not equal to or greater than 70.\n\n# Write code to verify that indices 1000 and beyond have values **below** 70\n# should be 0!\n\n\nTake the square root of all numbers in indices 38 to 465.\n\n\n# write your solution to prompt 10\n\n\nRound all numbers to the nearest whole number.\n\n\n# write your solution to prompt 11\n\n\nReplace all instances of the number 39 with 20.\n\n\n# write your solution to prompt 12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheckpoint\n\n\n\nHeadquarters has informed you that your final message should have 820 even numbers.\n\n\nHint: Checking for divisibility is an interesting operation that isn’t done much in R. Modulus is the operation you are interested in, where you are checking for whether the numbers are divisible by 2, with no remainder. See what you can find about modulus in R!\n\n# Code to verify how many even numbers are in your top_secret vector\n# Should be 820!",

For this we will use packages from the tidyverse but you can use base R or data.table if you have experience and feel more familiar with those.\nYou will see that 9 packages have been now attached to your workspace by calling the library(tidyverse) package bundle.

    "text": "Data cleaning\nIf you are interested in how to query data from OSM with R you can check the code I used here as well as the documentation for osmdata for small queries and osmextract for larger queries.\nSo now you know this is OpenStreetMap data. If you have ever worked with OSM data before you will know that their nodes have several tags with their properties attached to them. When querying the data with R, you will get in this case the queried huts in each row with all the tags in different columns forming a data frame.\nUsing this messy data you will be wrangling and tidying a bit so that you can work with a more manageable dataset in the next section.\n⚠️ From now on, each of the code chunks below will cause and error and/or will do the desired task incorrectly. (Even the chunks that run without error are not correct!) You will need to find the mistake, and correct it, to complete the intended action.\nYou will see a big amount of NA values in the huts data. That is because not all OSM tags are filled for every mountain hut, but if one hut has it, then it is included in the dataset.\nFirst, let’s reduce the number of variables in the dataset. Let’s narrow the dataset to:\n\nName of the hut\nElevation of the hut\nCapacity (no. of beds)\nAmenity (is it a restaurant, a bar, a self-service hut?)\nOperator of the hut (Alpenverein, Naturfreunde, etc.)\nLocation of the hut (the coordinates)\n\n\nhuts_clean &lt;- huts &gt; \n  select(name, ele, capacity, beds, amenity, cuisine, operator)\n\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'huts' not found\n\nhuts_clean\n\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'huts_clean' not found\n\n\nNow take a close look at the result of your selection, are all the columns that you asked for there? What about the geom column? Did you ask for it? Is it anyway there? Let’s try to get rid of it.\n\n# This chunk has no error\nhuts_clean |&gt; select(-geom)\n\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'huts_clean' not found\n\n\nOh no! It is still there! Well, that is because of how sf objects work. The geometry column is a “sticky” column, meaning that it cannot be dropped with tidyverse verbs. But, we want to work with spatial data, so we are not really going to remove that column. 😉\n\n\nIf you really want to remove the column you would need to do something like st_drop_geometry(huts_clean) or st_geometry(huts_clean) = NULL.\n\nNow, let’s adjust the proper variables to be numeric.\n\nhuts_clean &lt;- huts_clean |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    ele = numeric(ele),\n    capacity = numeric(capacity),\n    beds = numeric(beds)\n  )\n\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'huts_clean' not found\n\n\nNext, we drop the huts that are below 800 meters.\n\nhuts_clean &lt;- huts_clean |&gt; \n  filter(ele &lt; 800)\n\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'huts_clean' not found\n\n\n\nhuts |&gt; \n  select(name, ele, capacity, beds, amenity, cuisine, operator) |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    ele = as.numeric(ele),\n    capacity = as.numeric(capacity),\n    beds = as.numeric(beds)\n  ) |&gt; \n  filter(ele &gt;= 800)\n\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'huts' not found\n\n\n\nhuts |&gt; \n  summarise(across(everything(), ~ sum(!is.na(.)))) |&gt;\n  st_drop_geometry() |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(everything())\n\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'huts' not found",
