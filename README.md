## Overview 
These are the course materials for the IP: Application Development Course (GIS) - Part 2 where you will learn how to develop reproducible R workflows for spatial analysis. What you can expect:

-	Introduction to R and its ecosystem
-	Spatial data handling in R (raster and vector data)
-	Connecting to GIS software for spatial workflow automation
-	Spatial visualization with R (static and interactive)

## Objectives
By the end of the course you should be able:

-	to read and write R code and to navigate the R-spatial package ecosystem
-	to perform spatial analysis with vector and raster datasets in R
-	to design maps programmatically
-	to create reproducible workflows for spatial analysis in R
